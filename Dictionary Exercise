"""Write a program that asks user for three type of inputs:- 
- print: if user enter print then it should print all countries with their population in this format, china==>143 india==>136 usa==>32 pakistan==>21 
- add: if user input 'add' then it should further ask for a country name to add. If country already exist in our dataset then it should print
that it exist and do nothing. If it doesn't then it asks for population and add that new country/population in our
dictionary and print it 
- remove: when user inputs remove it should ask for a country to remove. If country exist in our dictionary then remove it and print new dictionary using format shown above in 
(a). Else print that countrydoesn't exist! 
- query: on this again ask user for which country he or she wants to query. When user inputs that
country it will print population of that country."""
